## What I've done

Today I have spent my time planning and creating an ERD using draw.io, which contains the following items:

- Products
- CartItem
- Cart
- Order
- ProductReview
- User (Comes with the setup in Next-auth, mandatory)
- Account (Comes with the setup in Next-auth, mandatory)
- Session (Comes with the setup in Next-auth, mandatory)
- VerificationToken (Comes with the setup in Next-auth, mandatory)

See link below to access the ERD.

I have also installed necessary npm packages in order to get started with the project.

## What I will do tomorow

I will continue with the ERD since it is not fully completed. It might require iteration throughout the project since it is my first time creating an ERD this big.
