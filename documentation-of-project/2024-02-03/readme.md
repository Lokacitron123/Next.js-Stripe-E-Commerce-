## What I've done

I added some more comments to the code and decided to add search functionality as well to the application. Now a user can search for things and it will try to find matching products by name or description.

And finally, I have turned in the assaignment.

## What I will do tomorow

## Thoughts

As I said in my presentation, the code is uneven in quality and there is some cleaning up to to do in terms of how I write my functions. Some of my functions declared
directly inside of my server/client components which I think is bad practise for readability and reusability.

Regretfully, I did not build the UI I would have liked for this project but it is something I will work on as a side project. Still, I am happy with the result of this application. I have learned a lot in the progress of building this application and I am looking forward to learn more about Next.js the coming months.
