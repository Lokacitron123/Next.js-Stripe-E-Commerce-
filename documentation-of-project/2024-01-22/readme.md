## What I've done

I worked on the logic for carts from localstorage to be merged with the cart of a user when they log in. This took me the whole morning, afternoon and the whole day of yesterday. There are still some bugs/ redundant code that I need to fix and or clean up.

I also worked today on creating orderedProducts out of the user's cart that was paid for. This took me quite a while because I couldnt figure out how to combine the cart into prima's nestled creation logic. With prisma you can create other items that are in relationship with the other thing you create in a nested manner. This will they will get relational IDs etc on the fly. Very useful now that I managed to understand how it works.

## What I will do tomorow

Tomorow I will add functionality for clearing the user's cart when the orders and orderedItems are created so that it emptied.

## Thoughts

I am a bit sceptical about what things to do ones that is in place. What my focus should be on. Currenlty the UI is more or less non existant. But I would like to work more on dashboard functionality.

Im thinking that I: A, underestimated the amount of work. Or B, my own capacity to create a project with the goals with the time that was given to us.

Eitherway, this can serv as a learning experience and hopefully my next project will go faster as I get to practise coding and learning E-commerce best practises.
