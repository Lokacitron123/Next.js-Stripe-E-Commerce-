## What I've done

Today I spent my time trying to create logic for adding an order, but I noticed that my SessionProvider was giving me an undefined value when I wanted to retrieve the logged in user and tie it to the order. And now Ive ran into errors that looks like this.

Error: "./node_modules/@mapbox/node-pre-gyp/lib/util/nw-pre-gyp/index.html
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (1:0)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file. See https://webpack.js.org/concepts#loaders

> <!doctype html>
>
> | <html>
> | <head>"

I need to investiage this further tomorow before I can proceed, otherwise Ill have to roll back my code.

## What I will do tomorow

Error handling.
