## What I've done

I worked on the UI instead of adding further crud operations to the dashboard of my admin and users.

I've tried making the cards for products more responsive to different screen sizes, and I also added a somewhat responsive layout for the header with two new links for men's and woman's clothing.

## What I will do tomorow

I will continue working on the UI a bit. and maybe see to the reviews functionality.
