## What I've done

Today I created my repo for the project, as well as started planning the backlog using Github issues.

## What I will do tomorow

I will start planning and creation of my ERD, which I will use in order to create the schema models using Prisma for my database.

I will also install the necessary packages for the project.

## Thoughts

Destructuring the project into issues in my backlog is more difficult than anticipated when creating a project on my own.
