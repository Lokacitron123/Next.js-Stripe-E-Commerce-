## What I've done

Spent the whole day trying to add providers and combine the credentialsprovider with server session. It didnt work because of limitations
on perpose by the next-auth team. Using passwords to log in is bad, specially when it done by yourself.

I have the google provider and credentialsprovider. Im only keeping the credentialsprovider for learning purposes.

## What I will do tomorow

Work on tying carts to a signed in user with useServerSession

## Thoughts

The documentation is lacklustered , specially for beginners on what is possible and what is not.
