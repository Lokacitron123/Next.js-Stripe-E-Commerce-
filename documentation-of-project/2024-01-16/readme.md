## What I've done

Today was spent on incorporating stripe payment which took a while because I had trouble finding what was necessary from the documentation. That aside, I can how create a payment but I need to incorporate logic for clearing the cart upon payment, decreasing the quanity of a variant, registering an order on the database. The schema for an order is set.

## What I will do tomorow

Tomorow I will work on the things mentioned above, making sure things are saved and cleared the way I intendend.

## Thoughts

The stripe documentation is difficult to navigate, leading to things taking longer than expected.
