## What I've done

I've worked on adding the addtocart functionality which proved a bit challenging and in need of a redo because I'm not saving a selected variant correctly. In the current setup, the all the variants goes with the saved product because I'm not correctly saving an Id for the selected variant to my cartItem in the database.

## What I will do tomorow

I will work on creating logic for adding a variant when I add a product as a cartItem to my cart.
