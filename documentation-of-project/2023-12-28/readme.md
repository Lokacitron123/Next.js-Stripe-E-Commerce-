## What I've done

Today I continued with the ERD but changes has been made but the final result of the schemas in my schemas.prisma-file is currently only set to be using the Product model due to difficutlies incorportating the relative schemas with the functionality and behaviour I want for my admin, add product, page.

Time spent on incorporating the add-product functionality and the schema has taken roughly 8 hours so far and is not yet complete.

However, I now have something to work with going forwards as I develop the application. Changes can be made later.

See link below to access the ERD.

## What I will do tomorow

Tomorow I will continue incorporating the schema with my adminpanel functionality, working on CRUD operations.
