## What I've done

Spent the whole day debugging the google provider because it only allowed me to log in with the first user from the ones Ive setup as test users
in the google project. The problem was a field in the usermodel that was invoked faulty.

I'm also trying to solve the account to cart connection because I want to set it up so that a logged in user will receive the cart from cookie storage if there is one available when the user logs in, merging it with the users current cart, or if it is empty, the localstorage cart populates the user cart.

## What I will do tomorow

I will continue working on the cart logic, but If I cant make it work quickly enough Im gonna go work some more on the order logic. Not yet done.

## Thoughts

This has proven more time consuming than I thought, and I will have to make prioritizes on what I want to implement with the time that is left.
I will not care for the frontent design unless I have some time left in the end.
