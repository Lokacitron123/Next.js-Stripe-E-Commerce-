## What I've done

Today I've, in the morning, been working on implementing the create function for a product. It required some iteration of the ER-diagram and may still be open to change but now for it is possible to add a product, as well as store color, size and a image in the product variant and store it in the database when creating a product.

The afternoon I've spent on the creating a products page as well as a single products page with necessary fetching functionality. I have also added the start of a product card component that will be used for rendering all products with the .map function in the products page.

I have added extra issues to my github actions.

## What I will do tomorow

Tomorow I will continue on the functionality of the these product pages, as well read up on how to properly set up metadata for my pages. I will also add new issues to my github actions.

## Thoughts

At the current moment I have all my fetching functionality stored with in my page.tsx files. I am considering moving them outside to a actions.ts file for reusability and readability of my page.tsx files.
