## What I've done

Today I've integrated orders on the userdashboard, so that the user can see what their order details (without the full product list atm though). Ive also added a "add review" to each order so that a user can leave a comment and leave a rating of 0 - 5. I learnt a little bit more about how to add server functions efficiently to the frontend, working with both client and server components. Wish I had thought about how to do this earlier because I will have to do some cleaning to make the code more streamlined. Currently it is a bit messy.

## What I will do tomorow

Tomorow I will add a reviews section to the product cards so that customers can view the ratings, as well as the comments. The UI is in dire need of work but it'll will have to suffice for now. I just want to have the functionality in place so that I later on can work on making the webpage beutiful as well.

Once that is in place I will start working on my presentation as well as cleaning up the code.
